# Memory Game
 Developed by Ahmed Magdy as part of the Udacity Front-end nanodegree.

## Game Description
- The game is simply a classic memory (matching) game that triggers your memory abilities to see if you can remember where you last saw a certain card within 16 cards. 
- There are 16 cards consisted of 8 pairs. You can only open 2 cards before the game checks if they match or not.
- If the clicked cards symbols match they will stay open and won't flip back. If the symbols differ, cards will flip back and 1 move will be charged against you.
- The more moves you make, the less rating you get (represented by stars)
- A timer on top right of the deck starts counting up with the very first click you make.
